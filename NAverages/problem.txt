Some quantities, such as the value of a stock, the size of a population, or the outdoor temperature, have frequent small fluctuations but tend to follow longer-term trends. It is helpful to evaluate such quantities in terms of a moving average: that is, the average of the most recent N measurements (N normally is in the range 3…10.) This technique “smooths out” the most recent fluctuations, exposing the overall trend. Write a program that will compute a moving average of order N for the price of a given stock on M consecutive days, where

M > N + 4.  

To do this, first read the values of N and M from the user. Next read the first N prices and store them in an array. Then repeat the process below for the remaining M-N prices:

a.       Compute and print the average of the N prices in the array.

b.       If all M values have been processed, quit and print a termination message.

c.       Otherwise, eliminate the value in array slot 0 and shift the other N-1 values one slot leftward.

Language: Java

d.       Read a new value into the empty slot at the end of the array.
