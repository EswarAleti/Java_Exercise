a minimum of three and a maximum of six pieces of user input about a race and provides a summary of facts about the race. Input will be via the keyboard and output (i.e., the summary of facts) will be via the display (a.k.a., console window). The pieces of user input will be the individual race times that correspond to all the racing participants; your program will prompt the user to enter these in via the keyboard. Note that you cannot assume these times will be in any particular order; putting them in order is one of the first things your program should after entry.

Ex.

How many racers? (three is min and six is max)
5
Enter the race times (in seconds):
85.6 120.5 90.2 94.66 79.22
Sorted race times... 79.22 85.6 90.2 94.66 120.5 0.0
First place (time in seconds): 79.22
Second place (time in seconds): 85.6
Third place (time in seconds): 90.2

How many racers? (three is min and six is max)
4
Enter the race times (in seconds):
1 1 4 3

Sorted race times... 1 1 3 4 0 0 
First place (time in seconds): 1.0
Second place (time in seconds): 1.0
Third place (time in seconds): 3.0

*NEED HELP figuring out how to get user input for an minimum value of 3 and max value of 6 from user keyboard input then prints out a similar output of values shown above. Any sort of code to this would be appreciated
