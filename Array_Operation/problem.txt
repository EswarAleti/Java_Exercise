1) Write a public static method named printArray, that takes two arguments. The first argument is an Array of int and the second argument is a String. The method should print out a list of the values in the array, each separated by the value of the second argument. For example, given the following Array declaration and instantiation: int[] myArray = {1, 22, 333, 400, 5005, 9}; printArray(myArray, ", ") will print out 1, 22, 333, 400, 5005, 9 printArray(myArray, " - ") will print out 1 - 22 - 333 - 400 - 5005 - 9 

2) Write a public static method named getFirst, that takes an Array of int as an argument and returns the value of the first element of the array. For example, given the following Array declaration and instantiation: int[] myArray = {1, 22, 333, 400, 5005, 9}; getFirst(myArray) will return 1 

3) Write a public static method named getLast, that takes an Array of int as an argument and returns the value of the last element of the array. For example, given the following Array declaration and instantiation: int[] myArray = {1, 22, 333, 400, 5005, 9}; getLast(myArray) will return 9 CSE110 Principles of Programming Assignment 06::100 pts P.Miller 2 

4) Write a public static method named getAllButFirst, that takes an Array of int as an argument and creates and returns a new array with all of the values in the argument array except the first value. For example, given the following Array declaration and instantiation: int[] myArray = {1, 22, 333, 400, 5005, 9}; getAllButFirst(myArray) will return an Array of int with these values {22, 333, 400, 5005, 9} 

5) Write a public static method named getIndexOfMin, that takes an Array of int as an argument and returns the index of the least value in the array. For example, given the following Array declaration and instantiation: int[] myArray = {333, 22, 1, 400, 5005, 9}; getIndexOfMin(myArray) will return 2 

6) Write a public static method named getIndexOfMax, that takes an Array of int as an argument and returns the index of the largest value in the array. For example, given the following Array declaration and instantiation: int[] myArray = {1, 22, 333, 400, 5005, 9}; getIndexOfMax(myArray) will return 4 

7) Write a public static method named swapByIndex, that takes three arguments. The first argument is an Array of int, and the second and third arguments are int indexes. This method will swap the values at the two given index arguments in the array, and return a reference to the array. For example, given the following Array declaration and instantiation: int[] myArray = {1, 22, 333, 400, 5005, 9}; swapByIndex(myArray, 1, 4) will return the Array with these values {1, 5005, 333, 400, 22, 9} 

8) Write a public static method named removeAtIndex, that takes two arguments. The first argument is an Array of int, and the second argument is an int index. This method create and return a new array with all of the values in the argument array except the value at the argument index. For example, given the following Array declaration and instantiation: int[] myArray = {1, 22, 333, 400, 5005, 9}; removeAtIndex(myArray, 3) will return an Array with these values {1, 22, 333, 5005, 9} 

9) Write a public static method named insertAtIndex, that takes three arguments. The first argument is an Array of int, the second argument is an int index, and the third argument is an int value. This method create and return a new array with all of the values in the argument array and including the third argument value inserted at the index specified by the second argument value. For example, given the following Array declaration and instantiation: int[] myArray = {1, 22, 333, 400, 9}; insertAtIndex(myArray, 2, 777) will return an Array with these values {1, 22, 777, 333, 400, 9} CSE110 Principles of Programming Assignment 06::100 pts P.Miller 3 

10) Write a public static method named isSorted, that takes an Array of int as an argument. This method should return the boolean value true if all the element values in the array are in ascending order; otherwise the method should return the boolean value false. For example, given the following Array declaration and instantiation: int[] myArray = {22, 5005, 400, 333, 1, 9}; isSorted(myArray) will return false
